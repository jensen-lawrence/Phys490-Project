# Data Generation

We use the package 'generate gravitational-wave data' by Timothy Gebhard.
The folder 'ggwd' contains a clone of the package from https://github.com/timothygebhard/ggwd.

We have included the following scripts to generate the testing and training datasets as described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04418.pdf.
 - generate_testing_data.py
 - generate_training_data.py
